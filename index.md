I am a computer sceince major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

Lab #3: I really enjoyed Lab #3 because it was the first time I got to see us implementing a
function into code. We calculated a person’s BMR for both men and women. I think I enjoyed
this lab because it opened my eyes to how you can make code do almost anything if fed teh
proper functions.
Lab # 12: This lab was difficult but I really enjoyed it because I felt like it differentiated from the
other labs entirely. Dealing with photos and graphics was not something that I had felt like I any
keen passion for, but when I began to do the coding I found it was actually entertaining. This
lab taught me that sometimes doing something I didn’t think I would enjoy can result in an
enjoyable experience.
Lab #6 Part 2: As someone who enjoys a good card game, figuring out how to code a blackjack
game was very interesting to me. It was very cool to see how things I was learning in class can
be applied to an activity I enjoy like the vector of strings and the blackjack game. This was
probably my favorite lab of the year because it didn’t feel as much of an assignment, rather
something that I wanted to do and I just happen to get credit for it.
